# Belly Button Biomes

This is an interactive dashboard that explores microbes colonizing human navels. The [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) is taken from the Rob Dunn lab.

The app for the dashboard is deployed on GitHub Pages, which can be seen by clicking here!

The dataset reveals that a small handful of operational taxonomic units, or OTUs were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The Data consists of demographic information, belly button wash frequency and OTU number. 

Whenever a new test subject ID number is selected from the dropdown menu, all visualizations will update.
